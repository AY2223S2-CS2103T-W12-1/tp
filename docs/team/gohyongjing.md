### Project: FriendlyLink

FriendlyLink is a personnel information management tool designed for Voluntary Welfare Organisations to keep elderly and volunteer records, and pair them up efficiently and effectively.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to pair up elderly and volunteers.
    * What it does: Allows elderly to be paired up with volunteers in the system
    * Justification: This feature allows the administrative staff to pair up elderly and volunteers so that they can take care of assigned elderly and keep them company.
    * Highlights: This feature checks if the members to be paired exists in FriendlyLink, and also prevents duplicate records from being added.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to see summary statistics.
  * What it does: Allows users to see summary statistics 
  * Justification: This feature allows the administrative staff to make sure each elderly member is taken care of and that the workload of volunteers is allocated evenly, recruiting more volunteers if required
  * Highlights: This feature is versatile and can be used with the `find` command to see statistics on a filtered list (E.g. See total number of volunteers in the north, or total number of elderly with high risk levels.)
