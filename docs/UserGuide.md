## Introduction
FriendlyLink **streamlines volunteer and elderly management** for single administrators of small VWOs. With FriendlyLink, administrators such as yourself can easily manage your database and pair volunteers with the elderly as you wish, all through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Our goal is to make volunteer and elderly management simple, efficient, and effective, so that you can focus on making a difference in your communities.

With its easy-to-use **text-based interface** and contact management features, say goodbye to manual record-keeping and hello to a more efficient and organised way of managing the volunteers’ and elderly’s contact details.

## Before you Begin

Please read this section before skipping to specific parts in the `Features` section

### Purpose of Guide

This guide aims to teach you how to navigate and use FriendlyLink

### How to use this User Guide

This guide quickly gets you started to use FriendlyLink, describing our features and providing their instruction format and examples. Some terms used have specific meanings and are explained below and summarised in the `Glossary`.

We suggest reading this guide in sequential order (or at least the whole of this section) to familiarise yourself with the keywords used in this guide in the glossary and differently styled text which have special meanings.

### How to Use FriendlyLink

FriendlyLink is a command line based tool. This means that it is designed to mainly receive text commands by you, and show you the output after each command is carried out. 

FriendlyLink stores the elderly, volunteers and pairings between the 2, which can be added, modified or removed by you using commands.

#### Commands
A command is an instruction given by you to FriendlyLink to perform a specific task. For example, `add_elderly n/John Doe ...` tells FriendlyLink to record the information of a new person in FriendlyLink. More details about each command is given in the **Features** section.

#### Prefixes
Prefixes are the characters appearing before a slash in a command. Prefixes describe the information that they represent. For example, the add elderly command `add_elderly ic/S1234567A ...` contains the prefix `ic` to indicate the NRIC of the elderly.
* Prefixes should be entered in all lower case (E.g. n/Abdul instead of N/Abdul)
* Fields after prefixes have leading and trailing whitespaces removed (e.g. `n/ Mary` is truncated to `n/Mary`)

#### Entities
An entity is a generic term for an object stored in FriendlyLink. It includes elderly, volunteers and pairs.

#### Indexes
Indexes are natural numbers (numbers used for counting) that are used for numbering purposes in a displayed list of entities.
* An index must be a positive integer (E.g. 1, 2, 3, …​)

#### Fields
Fields are the information following the slash in a command.
* For example, `add_elderly n/John Doe ic/...` has the prefix `n` followed by a slash, followed by the field `John Doe`. This tells FriendlyLink to record the newly added elderly with the name `John Doe`.
* Use fields to provide appropriate information to FriendlyLink, such as indicating a volunteer's name, phone number, email and other information.
* Fields can be entered in any order.
    * If a command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a field is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the field will be taken.<br>
    * If you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    * If you specify `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

FriendlyLink Fields are described below.

#### NRIC
NRIC is a unique identifier given to all Singaporeans.
* NRIC is case-insensitive

  * `@` is a letter that can be "S", "T", "F", "G", "M"
  * `XXXXXXX` is a 7-digit serial number
  * `#` is a letter from A to Z
* There is no cross validation of birthdate against NRIC (There are no checks for the birth year in first 2 digits of NRIC)

#### Phone number
The phone number of a person.
* Phone number is strictly numeric (digits from 0 to 9) and have more than 3 digits

#### Email
The email of a person
* Email must be in the `local-part@domain.com` format, containing the `@`

#### Date

* Date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
* Entering of dates before the current date is allowed
* Past dates will not be removed
* Where relevant, start date must occur before end date

#### Region

* Region must be one of the following value: `NORTH`, `NORTHEAST`, `CENTRAL`, `WEST` and `EAST`.

#### Risk Level
The susceptibility level of an elderly to injury or sickness.
* Risk level can only be one of the following value: `LOW`, `MEDIUM` or `HIGH`.
* Specified for elderly only.

* Medical qualification must be in the format `SKILL_NAME LEVEL`.
  * The `LEVEL` must be one of the following value: `BASIC`, `INTERMEDIATE` or `HIGH`.
  * Example: `CPR BASIC`, `AED INTERMEDIATE`.
* Specified for volunteers only.

#### Tags
A tag is a generic description for a group of people.
* Only alphanumeric characters are allowed.

#### Duplicate Entries
* Person (Elderly and Volunteers)
  * Two persons having the same NRIC are considered a duplicate entry in FriendlyLink, and is not allowed.
  * Persons with identical `NRIC` are considered the same person.
  * A person in FriendlyLink cannot be both an elderly and a volunteer at the same time.
* Pair
  * Two pairs having the same elderly and volunteer are considered a duplicate entry in FriendlyLink, and is not allowed.

#### Code highlights

*`Highlights` are used to denote specific terms, commands or output from the application. These are case-sensitive and may not give the correct results if you use different capitalisation or if you include additional space in them.

* Highlighted commands consists special characters or capitalisation, which have special meaning.
    * Words that are `CAPITALISED` are placeholders that should be replaced by you.<br>
      e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` should be replaced with actual information `add n/John Doe`.

    * Items in `[square brackets]` are optional.<br>
      e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or just `n/John Doe`.

    * Items with `[ellipsis]…` after them can be used 0 or more times.<br>
      e.g. `add_elderly n/NAME [t/TAG]…` can be used as `add_elderly n/John Doe` (no tags included), `add_elderly n/John Doe t/friend` (1 tag), `add_elderly n/John Doe t/friend t/family` (2 tags) and more.

* `add_volunteer n/Sally White bd/1990-11-05 ic/S8457677H re/EAST`

#### Pair volunteer and elderly: `pair`

Add a pairing between an existing elderly and volunteer.
This allows you to track which elderly members are assigned to which volunteers.

Format: `pair eic/ELDERLY_NRIC vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC`

* After pairing, the newly added pairs appear in the pair list in the window.
* Only elderly members and volunteers existing in FriendlyLink's data can be paired.
* Elderly member and volunteers with no common available dates can be paired but a warning message is issued.
* Elderly member and volunteers in different regions can be paired but a warning message is issued.
* Duplicate pairs will fail to be added to FriendlyLink.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes pairing**<br>

* A warning will be given if there are clashes in availability between the volunteer and elderly when pairing.

</div>

Examples:
* `pair eic/S2235243I vic/t0123423a` pairs up the elderly with NRIC S2235243I with the volunteer with NRIC T0123423A.
* `pair eic/s1135243A vic/S0773423a` pairs up the elderly with NRIC S1135243A with the volunteer with NRIC S0773423A.

#### Auto pairing of volunteers and elderly: `auto_pair`

Automatically pairs all unpaired elderly and volunteers, if possible. This command is intended to give
you a starting point for how the pairs can be formed, and aims to make the manual process of pairing
slightly easier. 

Format: `auto_pair`

* The volunteer and elderly in each pair generated will 
always have **matching regions** and **compatible availabilities**.
* In the event that no pairs can be formed satisfying the above constraints 
(either because there are no unpaired volunteers or elderly, or all the unpaired volunteers 
and elderly have incompatible regions or availabilities)
then a simple "_No pairs were formed._" message will be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How are the volunteers and elderly paired?**<br>

* The volunteers and elderly are paired in a _greedy_ manner: We essentially match each unpaired volunteer
with the first unpaired elderly that is compatible with it. 
* Furthermore, the pairs will be **one-to-one** i.e. every unpaired volunteer will be paired with at most
one unpaired elderly, and vice versa.
* This approach will not necessarily maximise the number of possible pairs, but it should serve as a good
starting point.

</div>

---------------------------------------------

### Editing records

Edit the information of an existing elderly or volunteer in FriendlyLink, based on their index or NRIC.

#### Editing an elderly by index : `edit_elderly`

Edits an existing elderly based on their index in the elderly list.

Format: `edit_elderly INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the elderly at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed elderly list.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified. 
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.
* You can remove all the elderly’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Same for available dates by typing `dr/`.

Examples:

* `edit_elderly 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st elderly to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit_elderly 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd elderly to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

#### Editing a volunteer by index: `edit_volunteer`

Edits an existing volunteer based on their index in the volunteers list.

Format: `edit_volunteer INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the volunteer at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed volunteer list. 
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags, medical qualifications or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.
* You can remove all the volunteer’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Same behavior as tags for available dates and medical qualifications by typing `dr/` and `mt/` respectively.

Examples:

* `edit_volunteer 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st volunteer to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit_volunteer 2 n/Betsy Crower mt/` Edits the name of the 2nd volunteer to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing medical qualifications.

#### Editing a person by NRIC: `edit`

Edits an existing elderly or volunteer identified by their NRIC.

Format: `edit NRIC [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the person identified by `NRIC`. As no people records of duplicate `NRIC` are allowed in FriendlyLink, one `NRIC` uniquely identifies one elderly or volunteer.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing elderly or volunteer-specific fields, if such fields do not match the identity of the target person, the change will be ignored. Example: `edit S1234567A r/LOW` will ignore the change of `RISK_LEVEL` to be `LOW` if `S1234567A` identifies a volunteer 
(as volunteers do not have a `RISK_LEVEL` attribute).
* When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags, medical qualifications or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Same behavior as tags for available dates and medical qualifications by typing `dr/` and `mt/` respectively.

Examples:

* `edit S2233556T p/91642345 re/NORTH` Edits the phone number of the person identified by `S2233556T` to be `91642345` and region to be `NORTH`.
* `edit S8833657U re/CENTRAL r/HIGH` Edits the region of the person identified by `S8833657U` to be `CENTRAL` and risk level to be `HIGH`. However, if `S8833657U` identifies a volunteer, the risk level edit will be ignored.
------------------------------------------------

### Deleting records

#### Deleting an elderly: `delete_elderly`

Deletes the specified elderly from FriendlyLink.

Format: `delete_elderly NRIC`

* Deletes the elderly with the specified NRIC `NRIC`.
* If no existing elderly matches the specified `NRIC`, FriendlyLink will inform the user that no such elderly exists.

* `delete_elderly S8238657A` deletes an existing elderly with NRIC `S8238657A`, as well as all the pairings containing this elderly.

#### Deleting a volunteer: `delete_volunteer`

Deletes the specified volunteer from FriendlyLink.

Format: `delete_volunteer NRIC`

* Deletes the volunteer with the specified NRIC `NRIC`.
* If no existing volunteer matches the specified `NRIC`, FriendlyLink will inform the user that no such volunteer exists.
* If the deleted volunteer has existing pairings, the corresponding pairing information will also be deleted.

Examples:

#### Unpair volunteer and elderly: `unpair`

Unpairs an elderly from its assigned volunteer.

This deletes the pair while still keeping the information of the elderly member and volunteer.

Format `unpair eic/ELDERLY_NRIC vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC`

* After deletion, the pair is removed in the list of pairs in the window.
* Alphabets in NRIC are case-insensitive.

Examples
* `unpair eic/S2235243I vic/t0123423a` unpairs the elderly with NRIC S2235243I with the volunteer with NRIC T0123423A.
* `unpair eic/s1135243A vic/S0773423a` unpairs the elderly with NRIC S1135243A with the volunteer with NRIC S0773423A.

-----------------------------------------

### Listing persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book or paired and unpaired persons if specified.

Format: `list [paired/unpaired]`

* All persons will be listed if "paired" or "unpaired" is not specified after the list word
* `[paired/unpaired]` is case-insensitive e.g. `pAIReD` will match `paired`.
* Pair list will always list all pairs when the command executes.

Examples:

* `list`
* `list paired`
* `list unpaired`

### Finding people and their related pairs: `find`

Finds any elderly or volunteers matching **all** the specified fields, and pairings that they are involved in.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS] [t/TAG] [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]`

* Fields can be in any order.
* The fields are optional so any combination of them is possible but **at least one** field must be specified.
* When multiple of the same field are specified, only the last one will be taken. e.g. `find n/jane n/john` will search for names that contain `john` only.
* The search is case-insensitive for all fields. e.g. `jANe` will match `Jane`.
* Specifying a certain portion of a field is possible except for `[r/RISK_LEVEL]`, `[mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]`, `[re/REGION]`, `[t/TAG]…` and `[dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…` e.g. `Joh` for the `n/NAME` field will match `John` and `John Doe`.
* For `[dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` date ranges that starts before or equal to `AVAILABLE_DATE_START` and ends after or equal to `AVAILABLE_DATE_END` will match.

Examples:

* `find t/experienced p/1234567 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Estate`
* `find n/John Wick e/johnwick@example.com a/New York p/1234561 ic/T1254567D re/north r/low, t/funny dr/2023-04-01,2023-04-15`

---------------------------------------

Shows the statistics of FriendlyLink.

This shows the total number of elderly, volunteers and pairs. It also shows the average number of elderly paired to volunteers and vice versa.
This command can be entered after the `find` command to show statistics on a subset of data (e.g. Find statistics of people in a particular region)

Format `stats`

* The summary is shown in the feedback box below your input.

Examples
* `stats` Display summary statistics on every person and pair.

* ```
  find n/alice
  stats
  ```
  Display summary statistics for all persons (and associated pairs) with `alice` in their name.

--------------------------------------------

### Editing the data file

FriendlyLink data are saved as a JSON file `JAR_FILE_LOCATION/data/elderly.json`, `JAR_FILE_LOCATION/data/volunteer.json` and `JAR_FILE_LOCATION/data/pair.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FriendlyLink will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

-------------------------------------------------

### Auto-complete

FriendlyLink provides auto-complete suggestions for the available commands, or attribute prefixes when adding new records of elderly or volunteers into the database.

Example:

* Typing `add_e` will suggest `add_elderly`.
* Typing `fi` will suggest `find`.

For adding records, if the user has not input all the available attributes for the new input elderly or volunteer, the
auto-complete feature will automatically suggests all the remaining attributes. No new suggestions will be given if all
possible attributes has at least one value provided.

Example:

* Typing `add_volunteer n/Harry p/12345686`, FriendlyLink will
  suggest `e/<email> a/<address> t/<tag> re/<region> mt/<medical_tags> bd/<birth_date> dr/<start_date,end_date>` as
  these attributes have not been filled.
*
Typing `add_volunteer n/Betsy p/1234567 e/test@test.com a/Linken Drive bd/1990-01-01 vnr/S8959886I re/NORTH t/experienced mt/CPR ADVANCED dr/2023-06-03,2023-06-17`
, FriendlyLink will not suggest anything as all possible attributes have at least one value.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* Input validation merely validates the set of possible attributes. If the user specifies an attribute that is
  not included in the list of accepted attributes, a warning will given. The user is free to continue typing, but an
  error will be thrown when the user confirms the command.
* There is a known UI bug when the text in `commandTextField` overflows. To improve user experience, the recommendation
  engine is disabled once overflow is detected.

</div>
