## Introduction
FriendlyLink **streamlines volunteer and elderly management** for single administrators of small VWOs. With FriendlyLink, administrators such as yourself can easily manage your database and pair volunteers with the elderly as you wish, all through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Our goal is to make volunteer and elderly management simple, efficient, and effective, so that you can focus on making a difference in your communities.

With its easy-to-use **text-based interface** and contact management features, say goodbye to manual record-keeping and hello to a more efficient and organised way of managing the volunteers’ and elderly’s contact details.

With FriendlyLink, you can record elderly and volunteer information and pair them up automatically. You can also update and delete records easily, and see a summary of all records in FriendlyLink!

----------------------------------------------------

## Before you Begin

Please read this section before skipping to specific parts ahead.

### How to use this User Guide

This guide aims to quickly get you started in using and navigating FriendlyLink.

We suggest reading this guide in sequential order (or at least the [Terminology](#terminology) section) to familiarise yourself with the keywords used in this guide in the glossary and differently styled text which have special meanings.

If you are already familiar with the [Terminology](#terminology),  you might want to go ahead to see the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide, [Features](#features) explained with examples, or [Fields](#fields) and their specification (Such as Email, phone numbers and addresses). All terms used are summarised in the [Glossary](#glossary)

You may see the following icons throughout our user guide, which are styled differently according to their purpose.

### Terminology

FriendlyLink is a command line based tool. This means that it is mainly designed to receive your text commands, and show you the output after each command is carried out.

FriendlyLink stores paired elderly and volunteers, which you can add, modify or remove.

#### Command
A command is an instruction given by you to FriendlyLink to perform a specific task. For example, `add_elderly n/John Doe ...` tells FriendlyLink to record the information of a new person in FriendlyLink. More details about each command is given in the [Features](#features) section.

#### Prefix
Prefixes are the characters appearing before a slash in a command. Prefixes label the information that they represent. For example, the add elderly command `add_elderly ic/S1234567A ...` contains the prefix `ic` to indicate that the text that follows is the NRIC of the elderly.
* Prefixes should be entered in all lower case (E.g. n/Abdul instead of N/Abdul)
* Fields after prefixes have leading and trailing whitespaces removed (E.g. `n/ Mary` is trimmed to `n/Mary`)

#### Field
Fields are the information following the slash in a command, to provide appropriate information to FriendlyLink, such as indicating a volunteer's name, phone number, email and other information.
* For example, `add_elderly n/John Doe ic/...` has the prefix `n` followed by a slash, followed by the field `John Doe`. This tells FriendlyLink to record the newly added elderly with the name `John Doe`.
* Fields can be entered in any order.
    * E.g. If a command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a field is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the field will be taken.<br>
    * E.g. If you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    * E.g. If you specify `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* For more information on each specific field, refer to the [Fields](#fields) section

#### Preamble
Preamble is a special piece of information specified for certain commands that are entered without prefixes
* They need to be specified right after the [command](#command) word and before any other [Fields](#field).
  * For example, `edit_elderly S1234567A n/John Doe` has the preamble `S1234567A`
  * On the other hand, specifying `edit_elderly n/John Doe S1234567A` is invalid as the preamble `S1234567A` has to come before all other fields.

#### Duplicate Entry
* Person (Elderly and Volunteers)
  * Two persons having the same [NRIC](#nric) are considered the same person and therefore a duplicate entry in FriendlyLink, and is not allowed.
  * The same person in FriendlyLink cannot be both an elderly and a volunteer at the same time.
* Pair
  * Two pairs having the same elderly and volunteer are considered a duplicate entry in FriendlyLink, and is not allowed.

#### Code highlight

`Highlights` are used to denote specific terms, commands or output from the application. These are case-sensitive and may not give the correct results if you use different capitalisation or if you include additional space in them.

* Highlighted commands consists special characters or capitalisation, which have special meaning.
    * Words that are `CAPITALISED` are placeholders that should be replaced by you.<br>
      E.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` should be replaced with actual information `add n/John Doe`.

    * Items in `[square brackets]` are optional.<br>
      E.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be entered as `n/John Doe t/friend` or just `n/John Doe`.

    * Items in `<angled brackets>` are the [preamble](#preamble).
      E.g. `edit_elderly <NRIC> n/NAME ...` can be entered as `edit_elderly S1234567A n/John Doe`.
      In some cases, they are also specified as `<[PREAMBLE]>` which indicates that the preamble is optional.

    * Items with `[ellipsis]…` after them can be entered 0 or more times.<br>
      E.g. `add_elderly n/NAME [t/TAG]…` can be entered as `add_elderly n/John Doe` (no tags included), `add_elderly n/John Doe t/friend` (1 tag), `add_elderly n/John Doe t/friend t/family` (2 tags) and more.

## Features

### Adding records

Adds an elderly, a volunteer, or a pairing between one elderly and one volunteer to FriendlyLink.

#### Adding an elderly: `add_elderly`

Adds an elderly to FriendlyLink.

Format: `add_elderly n/NAME ic/NRIC bd/BIRTH_DATE [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Every elderly must have a unique [NRIC](#nric).
* `AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END` represents the start and end of the [dates](#date) that the elderly is available.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
An elderly can have any number of tags and available dates.
</div>

Examples:

* `add_elderly n/John Wick ic/S1234567C bd/1950-02-03 re/NORTH r/HIGH`
* `add_elderly n/Betsy Crowe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street ic/S1234567C bd/1950-02-03 re/NORTH r/HIGH t/lonely dr/2023-06-03,2023-06-17`

#### Adding a volunteer: `add_volunteer`

Adds a volunteer to FriendlyLink.

Format: `add_volunteer ic/NRIC n/NAME bd/BIRTH_DATE [re/REGION] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​ [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…​`

* Every volunteer must have a unique [NRIC section](#nric).
* `AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END` represents the start and end of the dates that the volunteer is available.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
A volunteer can have any number of tags, medical qualifications and available dates. 
</div>

Examples:

* `add_volunteer n/John Wick bd/1990-11-05 e/johnwick@example.com a/New yourk p/1234561 ic/T1254567D dr/2023-04-01,2023-04-15 mt/CPR, BASIC`
* `add_volunteer n/Sally White bd/1990-11-05 ic/S8457677H re/EAST`

#### Pair volunteer and elderly: `pair`

Add a pairing between an existing elderly and volunteer.
This allows you to track which elderly members are assigned to which volunteers.

Format: `pair eic/ELDERLY_NRIC vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC`

* After pairing, the newly added pairs appear in the pair list in the window.
* Only elderly members and volunteers existing in FriendlyLink's data can be paired.
* [Duplicate pairs](#duplicate-entry) will fail to be added to FriendlyLink.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
   
**:information_source: Info**<br>
When the elderly and volunteer to be paired:
  * has clashes in availability [dates](#date); or
  * lives in different [regions](#region)

The pair will be successfully added but a warning will be given.
</div>

Examples:
* `pair eic/s6414118Z vic/S1262951f` pairs up the elderly with NRIC S6414118Z with the volunteer with NRIC S1262951F.
  <img src="images/userGuide/pair.png" width="800" />
* `pair eic/s1135243A vic/S0773423a` pairs up the elderly with NRIC S1135243A with the volunteer with NRIC S0773423A.

#### Auto pairing of volunteers and elderly: `auto_pair`

Automatically pairs all unpaired elderly and volunteers, if possible. This command is intended to give
you a starting point for how the pairs can be formed, and aims to make the manual process of pairing
slightly easier. 

Format: `auto_pair`

* The volunteer and elderly in each pair generated will 
always have **compatible [regions](#region) and available [dates](#date)**.
   * We consider a volunteer/elderly with no specified region to be compatible with _any_ region. Similarly, a volunteer/elderly with no availabilities specified will be considered to be available at _any_ time. 
* In the event that no pairs can be formed satisfying the above constraints 
(either because there are no unpaired volunteers or elderly, or all the unpaired volunteers 
and elderly have incompatible regions or availabilities)
then a simple "_No pairs were formed._" message will be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How are the volunteers and elderly paired?**<br>

* The volunteers and elderly are paired in a _greedy_ manner: We essentially match each unpaired volunteer
with the first unpaired elderly that is compatible with it. 
* Furthermore, the pairs will be **one-to-one** i.e. every unpaired volunteer will be paired with at most
one unpaired elderly, and vice versa.
* This approach will not necessarily maximise the number of possible pairs, but it should serve as a good
starting point.

</div>

-------------------------------------------

### Editing records

Edit the information of an existing elderly or volunteer in FriendlyLink, based on their [index](#index) or [NRIC](#nric).

#### Editing an elderly by index : `edit_elderly`

Edits an existing elderly based on their [index](#index) in the elderly list.

Format: `edit_elderly <INDEX> [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the elderly at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed elderly list.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified. 
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning**
When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all the elderly’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Available dates have the same behaviour if you type `dr/`.
</div>

Examples:
* `edit_elderly 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the [phone number](#phone-number) and [email address](#email) of the 1st elderly to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit_elderly 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd elderly to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing [tags](#tags).

#### Editing a volunteer by index: `edit_volunteer`

Edits an existing volunteer based on their [index](#index) in the volunteers list.

Format: `edit_volunteer <INDEX> [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the volunteer at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed volunteer list. 
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning**
When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags, medical qualifications or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all the volunteer’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Available dates and medical qualifications have the same behaviour if you type `dr/` and `mt/` respectively.
</div>

Examples:

* `edit_volunteer 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the [phone number](#phone-number) and [email address](#phone-number) of the 1st volunteer to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit_volunteer 2 n/Betsy Crower mt/` Edits the name of the 2nd volunteer to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing [medical qualifications](#medical-qualification).
* `edit_volunteer 3 mt/CPR, BASIC mt/CARETAKING, ADVANCED` Replaces all existing [medical qualifications](#medical-qualification) of the 3rd volunteer with `CPR, BASIC` and `CARETAKING, ADVANCED`.

#### Editing a person by NRIC: `edit`

Edits an existing elderly or volunteer identified by their [NRIC](#nric).

Format: `edit <NRIC> [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the person identified by `NRIC`. As no people records of duplicate `NRIC` are allowed in FriendlyLink, one `NRIC` uniquely identifies one elderly or volunteer.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing elderly or volunteer-specific fields, if such fields do not match the identity of the target person, the change will be ignored. Example: `edit S1234567A r/LOW` will ignore the change of `RISK_LEVEL` to be `LOW` if `S1234567A` identifies a volunteer 
(as volunteers do not have a [Risk Level](#risk-level)).


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning**
When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags, medical qualifications or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative. 
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Available dates and medical qualifications have the same behaviour if you type `dr/` and `mt/` respectively.
</div>
Examples:

* `edit S2233556T p/91642345 re/NORTH` Edits the [phone number](#phone-number) and [region](#region) of the person identified by `S2233556T` to be `91642345` and `NORTH` respectively.
* `edit S8833657U re/CENTRAL r/HIGH` Edits the [region](#region) and risk level of the person identified by `S8833657U` to be `CENTRAL` and `HIGH` respectively. However, if `S8833657U` identifies a volunteer, the [risk level](#risk-level) edit will be ignored.
* `edit S2568212B t/Overseas t/Undergrad` Replaces all existing [tags](#tags) of the person identified by `S2568212B` with the tags `Overseas` and `Undergrad` 

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

-------------------------------------------

### Deleting records

Delete the specific existing elderly or volunteer in FriendlyLink with the given [NRIC](#nric).

#### Deleting an elderly: `delete_elderly`

Deletes the specified elderly from FriendlyLink.

Format: `delete_elderly <NRIC>`

* Deletes the elderly with the specified [NRIC](#nric).
* If no existing elderly matches the specified `NRIC`, FriendlyLink will inform the user that no such elderly exists.
* If the deleted elderly has existing pairings, the corresponding volunteer will be unpaired.

Examples:
* `delete_elderly S8238657A` deletes an existing elderly with NRIC `S8238657A`, as well as all the pairings containing this elderly.

#### Deleting a volunteer: `delete_volunteer`

Deletes the specified volunteer from FriendlyLink.

Format: `delete_volunteer <NRIC>`

* Deletes the volunteer with the specified [NRIC](#nric).
* If no existing volunteer matches the specified `NRIC`, FriendlyLink will inform the user that no such volunteer exists.
* If the deleted volunteer has existing pairings, the corresponding elderly will be unpaired.

Examples:
* `delete_volunteer S8238658J` deletes an existing volunteer with NRIC `S8238658J`, as well as all the pairings containing this volunteer.

#### Unpair volunteer and elderly: `unpair`

Unpairs an elderly from its assigned volunteer.
This deletes the pair while still keeping the elderly and volunteer in FriendlyLink.

Format `unpair eic/ELDERLY_NRIC vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC`

* After deletion, the pair is removed from the list of pairs in the window.

Examples
* `unpair eic/s6414118Z vic/S1262951f` unpairs the elderly with NRIC S6414118Z with the volunteer with NRIC S1262951F (Refer to previously added [pair](#pair-volunteer-and-elderly--pair) example).
  <img src="images/userGuide/unpair.png" width="800" />
* `unpair eic/s1135243A vic/S0773423a` unpairs the elderly with NRIC S1135243A with the volunteer with NRIC S0773423A.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

-------------------------------------------

### Finding records

Finds the information of an existing elderly, volunteer or pairs in FriendlyLink, based on some keywords or conditions.

#### Finding people and their related pairs: `find`

Finds any elderly or volunteers matching **all** the relevant specified fields, and pairings that they are involved in.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS] [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* The fields are optional so any combination of them is possible but **at least one** field must be specified.
* The search is case-insensitive for all fields. E.g. `jANe` will match `Jane`.
* Elderly specific fields will not be searched for in the volunteer list and vice versa.
  * `find r/HIGH` will show all volunteers since volunteers do not contain [risk level](#risk-level) field.
  * `find mt/cpr, basic` will show all elderly since elderly do not contain [medical qualifications](#medical-qualification) field.
* `[n/NAME]` `[ic/NRIC]` `[p/PHONE_NUMBER]` `[e/EMAIL]` `[a/ADDRESS]` `[t/TAG]` need not be specified in full E.g. `Joh` for the `n/NAME` field will match `John` and `John Doe`.
  * Such fields can contain any value but cannot be empty.
* `[r/RISK_LEVEL]`, `[bd/BIRTH_DATE]`, `[re/REGION]` and `[dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` are required to be fully specified.
* `[dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` will find any [date range](#available-dates) that contains the specified range.
  * People with no dates will be found because having no dates means that they are available all the time.
* For `[mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]` you can either specify just the type E.g. `mt/cpr` or the type and its level separated by comma E.g. `mt/cpr, basic`.
    * The type need not be specified in full, so it can contain any non-empty value.
    * Qualification level needs to be fully specified if present.

Examples:
* `find n/john` finds all volunteers or elderly whose name contains `john`.
* `find re/NORTH t/lonely` finds all volunteers or elderly who has the region `NORTH` and tag containing `lonely`.

#### Listing persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in FriendlyLink or paired and unpaired persons if specified.

Format: `list <[PAIRED \ UNPAIRED]>`

* `<[PAIRED \ UNPAIRED]>` indicates that either "paired" or "unpaired" can be specified after the list command.
    * If "paired" or "unpaired" is not specified, all persons will be listed.
* The preamble is case-insensitive E.g. `pAIReD` will match `paired`.
* Pair list will always list all pairs when the command executes.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
`list` is useful if you want to see all persons and pairs after they have been filtered by the find command.
</div>

Examples:
* `list`
* `list paired`
* `list unpaired`

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

-------------------------------------------

### Show Summary Statistics: `stats`

Shows the statistics of FriendlyLink.

This shows the total number of elderly, volunteers and pairs. It also shows the maximum number of elderly paired to each volunteer and vice versa.
This command can be entered after the [find](#finding-people-and-their-related-pairs--find) command to show statistics on a subset of data (E.g. Find statistics of people in a particular region)

Format `stats`

* The summary is shown below.
  <img src="images/userGuide/stats.png" width="800" />

Examples
* `stats` Display summary statistics on every person and pair.

* ```
  find re/NORTH
  stats
  ```
  Display summary statistics for all persons (and associated pairs) living in the north.
  <img src="images/userGuide/findStats.png" width="800" />

-------------------------------------------

### Command Recommendation

FriendlyLink provides command recommendations for registered [commands](#command) and [field's](#field) [prefixes](#prefix).

<img src="images/CommandRecommendations.png" alt="Command Recommendation Example">

For example, when adding an elderly, the recommendation engine will automatically recommend all available field prefixes.
No new suggestions will be given once all possible prefixes has at least one value provided. If the user continues 
to specify more attributes like `t/`, the recommendation will be done on a case-by-case basis.

Example:

* Typing `add_volunteer n/Harry p/12345686 `, FriendlyLink will
  suggest `bd/BIRTH_DATE ic/NRIC e/[EMAIL] a/[ADDRESS] re/[REGION] mt/[MEDICAL_QUALIFICATION] t/[TAG] dr/[AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` as
  these fields have not been filled. 
* Typing `add_volunteer n/Betsy p/1234567 e/test@test.com a/Linken Drive bd/1990-01-01 ic/S8959886I re/NORTH t/experienced mt/CPR,ADVANCED dr/2023-06-03,2023-06-17` 
  will not suggest anything by default as all possible fields have at least one value.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on Command Recommendation**<br>

* The order of fields specified here may not be what is reflected in the application.
* When invalid inputs are detected, the text field will turn red, indicating a warning. You are, however, free to continue typing.
* There is a known UI bug when the text in `command box` overflows. To improve user experience, command recommendation is disabled once overflow is detected.

</div>

-------------------------------------------

### Saving the data

FriendlyLink data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to
save manually.

## Fields
This section describes the format and specifications of each field.

<div class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: <em>Note on character limits</em> <br>
There is <em>no</em> max character limit enforced on most fields. The reasoning behind this is that we do not want to unnecessarily restrict you from entering possible long fields (For example, a long name). 
We recommend using entering fields of length at most 100.
</div>

    * `@` is a letter that can be "S", "T", "F", "G", "M"
    * `XXXXXXX` is a 7-digit serial number
    * `#` is a letter from A to Z
* There is no cross validation of birthdate against NRIC (There are no checks for the birth year in first 2 digits of NRIC)

### Index

The `local-part` must
* only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-).
* not start or end with any special characters. 

This is followed by a '@' and then a domain. The domain is made up of alphanumeric domain labels separated by 1 or more periods.

The `domain` must:
* end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
* have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
* have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

E.g. JohnDoe@email.sg

* Specified for volunteers only.

### Available Dates

The availability of a person, in the same format as other [dates](#date).
* The start date of the available period must come before its end date.
* A person with no specified available dates is considered as available all the time.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
