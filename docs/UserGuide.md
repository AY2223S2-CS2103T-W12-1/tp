## Introduction
FriendlyLink **streamlines volunteer and elderly management** for single administrators of small VWOs. With FriendlyLink, administrators such as yourself can easily manage your database and pair volunteers with the elderly as you wish, all through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Our goal is to make volunteer and elderly management simple, efficient, and effective, so that you can focus on making a difference in your communities.

With its easy-to-use **text-based interface** and contact management features, say goodbye to manual record-keeping and hello to a more efficient and organised way of managing the volunteers’ and elderly’s contact details.

#### FriendlyLink
FriendlyLink is a command line based tool. This means that it is mainly designed to receive your text commands, and show you the output after each command is carried out.

FriendlyLink stores paired elderly and volunteers, which you can add, modify or remove.

#### Commands
A command is an instruction given by you to FriendlyLink to perform a specific task. For example, `add_elderly n/John Doe ...` tells FriendlyLink to record the information of a new person in FriendlyLink. More details about each command is given in the `Features` section.

#### Prefixes
Prefixes are the characters appearing before a slash in a command. Prefixes label the information that they represent. For example, the add elderly command `add_elderly ic/S1234567A ...` contains the prefix `ic` to indicate that the text that follows is the NRIC of the elderly.
* Prefixes should be entered in all lower case (E.g. n/Abdul instead of N/Abdul)
* Fields after prefixes have leading and trailing whitespaces removed (e.g. `n/ Mary` is truncated to `n/Mary`)

#### Entities
An entity is a generic term for an object stored in FriendlyLink. It includes elderly, volunteers and pairs.

#### Indexes
Indexes are natural numbers (numbers used for counting) that are used for numbering entities in a list.
* An index must be a positive integer (E.g. 1, 2, 3, …​)

#### Fields
Fields are the information following the slash in a command, to provide appropriate information to FriendlyLink, such as indicating a volunteer's name, phone number, email and other information.
* For example, `add_elderly n/John Doe ic/...` has the prefix `n` followed by a slash, followed by the field `John Doe`. This tells FriendlyLink to record the newly added elderly with the name `John Doe`.
* Fields can be entered in any order.
    * E.g. If a command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a field is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the field will be taken.<br>
    * E.g. If you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    * E.g. If you specify `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

#### Duplicate Entries
* Person (Elderly and Volunteers)
  * Two persons having the same `NRIC` are considered the same person and therefore a duplicate entry in FriendlyLink, and is not allowed.
  * The same person in FriendlyLink cannot be both an elderly and a volunteer at the same time.
* Pair
  * Two pairs having the same elderly and volunteer are considered a duplicate entry in FriendlyLink, and is not allowed.

#### Code highlights

`Highlights` are used to denote specific terms, commands or output from the application. These are case-sensitive and may not give the correct results if you use different capitalisation or if you include additional space in them.

* Highlighted commands consists special characters or capitalisation, which have special meaning.
    * Words that are `CAPITALISED` are placeholders that should be replaced by you.<br>
      e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` should be replaced with actual information `add n/John Doe`.

    * Items in `[square brackets]` are optional.<br>
      e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or just `n/John Doe`.

    * Items with `[ellipsis]…` after them can be used 0 or more times.<br>
      e.g. `add_elderly n/NAME [t/TAG]…` can be used as `add_elderly n/John Doe` (no tags included), `add_elderly n/John Doe t/friend` (1 tag), `add_elderly n/John Doe t/friend t/family` (2 tags) and more.

* `add_volunteer n/Sally White bd/1990-11-05 ic/S8457677H re/EAST`

#### Pair volunteer and elderly: `pair`

Add a pairing between an existing elderly and volunteer.
This allows you to track which elderly members are assigned to which volunteers.

Format: `pair eic/ELDERLY_NRIC vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC`

* After pairing, the newly added pairs appear in the pair list in the window.
* Only elderly members and volunteers existing in FriendlyLink's data can be paired.
* Elderly member and volunteers with no common available dates can be paired but a warning message is issued.
* Elderly member and volunteers in different regions can be paired but a warning message is issued.
* Duplicate pairs will fail to be added to FriendlyLink.
* Alphabets in NRIC are case-insensitive.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
   
**:information_source: Info**<br>
* A warning will be given when:
   * there are clashes in availability between the volunteer and elderly; or
   * the volunteer and elderly lives in different regions
   
</div>

Examples:
* `pair eic/S2235243I vic/t0123423a` pairs up the elderly with NRIC S2235243I with the volunteer with NRIC T0123423A.
* `pair eic/s1135243A vic/S0773423a` pairs up the elderly with NRIC S1135243A with the volunteer with NRIC S0773423A.

#### Auto pairing of volunteers and elderly: `auto_pair`

Automatically pairs all unpaired elderly and volunteers, if possible. This command is intended to give
you a starting point for how the pairs can be formed, and aims to make the manual process of pairing
slightly easier. 

Format: `auto_pair`

* The volunteer and elderly in each pair generated will 
always have **compatible regions and availabilities**.
   * We consider a volunteer/elderly with no specified region to be compatible with _any_ region. Similarly, a volunteer/elderly with no availabilities specified will be considered to be available at _any_ time. 
* In the event that no pairs can be formed satisfying the above constraints 
(either because there are no unpaired volunteers or elderly, or all the unpaired volunteers 
and elderly have incompatible regions or availabilities)
then a simple "_No pairs were formed._" message will be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How are the volunteers and elderly paired?**<br>

* The volunteers and elderly are paired in a _greedy_ manner: We essentially match each unpaired volunteer
with the first unpaired elderly that is compatible with it. 
* Furthermore, the pairs will be **one-to-one** i.e. every unpaired volunteer will be paired with at most
one unpaired elderly, and vice versa.
* This approach will not necessarily maximise the number of possible pairs, but it should serve as a good
starting point.

</div>

---------------------------------------------

### Editing records

Edit the information of an existing elderly or volunteer in FriendlyLink, based on their index or NRIC.

#### Editing an elderly by index : `edit_elderly`

Edits an existing elderly based on their index in the elderly list.

Format: `edit_elderly INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the elderly at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed elderly list.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified. 
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all the elderly’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Same for available dates by typing `dr/`.
</div>

Examples:

* `edit_elderly 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st elderly to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit_elderly 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd elderly to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

#### Editing a volunteer by index: `edit_volunteer`

Edits an existing volunteer based on their index in the volunteers list.

Format: `edit_volunteer INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the volunteer at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed volunteer list. 
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags, medical qualifications or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all the volunteer’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Same behavior as tags for available dates and medical qualifications by typing `dr/` and `mt/` respectively.
</div>

Examples:

* `edit_volunteer 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st volunteer to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit_volunteer 2 n/Betsy Crower mt/` Edits the name of the 2nd volunteer to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing medical qualifications.

#### Editing a person by NRIC: `edit`

Edits an existing elderly or volunteer identified by their NRIC.

Format: `edit NRIC [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]… [t/TAG]… [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]…`

* Edits the person identified by `NRIC`. As no people records of duplicate `NRIC` are allowed in FriendlyLink, one `NRIC` uniquely identifies one elderly or volunteer.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing elderly or volunteer-specific fields, if such fields do not match the identity of the target person, the change will be ignored. Example: `edit S1234567A r/LOW` will ignore the change of `RISK_LEVEL` to be `LOW` if `S1234567A` identifies a volunteer 
(as volunteers do not have a `RISK_LEVEL` field).
* When editing fields allowing multiple inputs, the existing contents of the field will be removed. i.e. editing of tags, medical qualifications or available dates will overwrite previous ones and are not cumulative. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it. Same behavior as tags for available dates and medical qualifications by typing `dr/` and `mt/` respectively.
</div>
Examples:

* `edit S2233556T p/91642345 re/NORTH` Edits the phone number of the person identified by `S2233556T` to be `91642345` and region to be `NORTH`.
* `edit S8833657U re/CENTRAL r/HIGH` Edits the region of the person identified by `S8833657U` to be `CENTRAL` and risk level to be `HIGH`. However, if `S8833657U` identifies a volunteer, the risk level edit will be ignored.

------------------------------------------------

### Deleting records

Delete the specific existing elderly or volunteer in FriendlyLink with the given NRIC.

#### Deleting an elderly: `delete_elderly`

Deletes the specified elderly from FriendlyLink.

Format: `delete_elderly NRIC`

* Deletes the elderly with the specified NRIC `NRIC`.
* If no existing elderly matches the specified `NRIC`, FriendlyLink will inform the user that no such elderly exists.
* If the deleted elderly has existing pairings, the corresponding volunteer will be unpaired.

Examples:
* `delete_elderly S8238657A` deletes an existing elderly with NRIC `S8238657A`, as well as all the pairings containing this elderly.

#### Deleting a volunteer: `delete_volunteer`

Deletes the specified volunteer from FriendlyLink.

Format: `delete_volunteer NRIC`

* Deletes the volunteer with the specified NRIC `NRIC`.
* If no existing volunteer matches the specified `NRIC`, FriendlyLink will inform the user that no such volunteer exists.
* If the deleted volunteer has existing pairings, the corresponding elderly will be unpaired.

Examples:
* `delete_volunteer S8238658J` deletes an existing volunteer with NRIC `S8238658J`, as well as all the pairings containing this volunteer.

#### Unpair volunteer and elderly: `unpair`

Unpairs an elderly from its assigned volunteer.
This deletes the pair while still keeping the elderly and volunteer.

Format `unpair eic/ELDERLY_NRIC vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC`

* After deletion, the pair is removed from the list of pairs in the window.

Examples
* `unpair eic/S2235243I vic/t0123423a` unpairs the elderly with NRIC S2235243I with the volunteer with NRIC T0123423A.
* `unpair eic/s1135243A vic/S0773423a` unpairs the elderly with NRIC S1135243A with the volunteer with NRIC S0773423A.

-----------------------------------------

### Listing persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in FriendlyLink or paired and unpaired persons if specified.

Format: `list [paired/unpaired]`

* All persons will be listed if "paired" or "unpaired" is not specified after the list word
* `[paired/unpaired]` is case-insensitive e.g. `pAIReD` will match `paired`.
* Pair list will always list all pairs when the command executes.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
`list` is useful if you need to refresh all the lists after they have been filtered.
</div>
Examples:

* `list` lists all elderly, volunteers and pairs.
* `list paired` lists all paired elderly, paired volunteers and all pairs.
* `list unpaired` lists all unpaired elderly, unpaired volunteers and all pairs.

--------------------------------------

### Finding people and their related pairs: `find`

Finds any elderly or volunteers matching **all** the relevant specified fields, and pairings that they are involved in.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [bd/BIRTH_DATE] [re/REGION] [r/RISK_LEVEL] [mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS] [t/TAG] [dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]`

* Fields can be in any order.
* The fields are optional so any combination of them is possible but **at least one** field must be specified.
* The search is case-insensitive for all fields. e.g. `jANe` will match `Jane`.
* Elderly specific fields will not be searched for in the volunteer list and vice versa.
  * `find r/HIGH` will show all volunteers since volunteers do not contain risk level field.
  * `find mt/cpr, basic` will show all elderly since elderly do not contain medical qualifications field.
* `[n/NAME]` `[ic/NRIC]` `[p/PHONE_NUMBER]` `[e/EMAIL]` `[a/ADDRESS]` `[t/TAG]` need not be specified in full e.g. `Joh` for the `n/NAME` field will match `John` and `John Doe`.
  * Such fields can contain any value but cannot be empty.
* `[r/RISK_LEVEL]`, `[bd/BIRTH_DATE]`, `[re/REGION]` and `[dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` are required to be fully specified.
  * Such fields have to be valid.
* `[dr/AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` will find any date range that contains the specified range
  * People with no dates will be found because having no dates means that they are available all the time.
* For `[mt/MEDICAL_QUALIFICATIONS]` you can either specify just the type e.g. `mt/cpr` or the type and its level separated by comma e.g. `mt/cpr, basic`.
    * The type need not be specified in full so it can contain any non-empty value.
    * Qualification level needs to be fully specified if present.

Examples:

* `find n/john` finds all volunteers or elderly whose name contains `john`.
* `find re/NORTH t/lonely` finds all volunteers or elderly who has the region `NORTH` and tag containing `lonely`.

---------------------------------------

### Show Summary Statistics: `stats`

Shows the statistics of FriendlyLink.

This shows the total number of elderly, volunteers and pairs. It also shows the maximum number of elderly paired to each volunteer and vice versa.
This command can be entered after the `find` command to show statistics on a subset of data (e.g. Find statistics of people in a particular region)

Format `stats`

* The summary is shown in the feedback box below your input.

Examples
* `stats` Display summary statistics on every person and pair.

* ```
  find re/NORTH
  stats
  ```
  Display summary statistics for all persons (and associated pairs) living in the north.

-------------------------------------------

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

---------------------------------------------

### Auto-complete

FriendlyLink provides auto-complete suggestions for the available commands, or a field prefixes when adding new records of elderly or volunteers into the database.

Example:

* Typing `add_e` will suggest `add_elderly`.
* Typing `fi` will suggest `find`.

For adding records, if the user has not input all the available fields for the new input elderly or volunteer, the
auto-complete feature will automatically recommend all remaining prefixes. No new suggestions will be given once all
possible prefixes has at least one value provided. If the user continues to specify more attributes like `t/`, the recommendation
will be done on a case-by-case basis.

Example:

* Typing `add_volunteer n/Harry p/12345686`, FriendlyLink will
  suggest `bd/BIRTH_DATE ic/NRIC e/[EMAIL] a/[ADDRESS] t/[TAG] re/[REGION] mt/[MEDICAL_QUALIFICATION] dr/[AVAILABLE_DATE_START, AVAILABLE_DATE_END]` as
  these fields have not been filled. Note that the order of fields specified here may not be what is reflected in the application.
* Typing `add_volunteer n/Betsy p/1234567 e/test@test.com a/Linken Drive bd/1990-01-01 vnr/S8959886I re/NORTH t/experienced mt/CPR, ADVANCED dr/2023-06-03,2023-06-17`
, FriendlyLink will not suggest anything by default as all possible fields have at least one value.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on Command Recommendation**<br>

* If the user specifies a field that is not included in the list of accepted fields, a warning will given. The user is free to continue typing, but an
  error will be thrown when the user confirms the command.
* There is a known UI bug when the text in `command box` overflows. To improve user experience, command recommendation is disabled once overflow is detected.
