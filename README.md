FriendlyLink streamlines volunteer and elderly management for single administrators of small NPOs. With its easy-to-use text-based interface and contact management features, say goodbye to manual record-keeping and hello to a more efficient and organised way of managing the volunteers’ and elderly’s contact details.

* The project is an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FriendlyLink_) used for managing details of elderly members and volunteers for Non-Profit Organisations.
* It is **written in OOP fashion** and comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FriendlyLink Product Website]()**.
* This project is modified from [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3) created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). If you would like to contribute code to the original project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
